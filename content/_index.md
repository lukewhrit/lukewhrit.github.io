title: Hi, I'm Luke

Hey, I’m Luke. I’m a self taught software engineer and high school senior. I’m the lead developer of [Spacebin](spaceb.in), [Redeyes](rdy.es), and a handful of projects, along with being a recurring contributor to many more. My full resume and portfolio are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-whritenour-b1a6b7312/) and [Github](https://github.com/lukewhrit).

I began programming at age 12. Since then, I’ve developed a lot of different websites, chatbots, and other projects. Recently, I’ve begun to focus on creating software with the intent to replace the overcomplicated software and make the internet less frustrating. My projects see 10,000+ monthly users and solve problems in many fields. If you are interested in working together, please send me an email: [lukewhrit@proton.me](mailto:lukewhrit@proton.me)

As a high school student, I have completed 80+ community service hours, taken many college and Honors courses, been an active member of multiple clubs and Student Government, and maintained a 3.9 GPA over the years. Alongside academics, I am a Varsity swimmer and compete for the Scarlet Aquatics club team year-round.
