title: Hi, I'm Luke

Hey, I'm Luke. I'm a self-taught software engineer and high school senior. I'm the lead developer of [Spacebin](https://spaceb.in), and [redeyes](https://rdy.es). I also maintain several smaller projects and contribute to many more. I'm available for hire as a freelance developer. I have experience in major programming languages (Go, Python, NodeJS, HTML/CSS, etc.) and related tools like CI/CD, SQL, Creative Cloud, networking, and more.

I began programming when I was 12 years old, after watching a YouTube tutorial on how to make an HTML website. Since then, I've learned more languages, developed many apps/websites, and become a highly experienced full-stack programmer and designer. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an [email](mailto:lukewhrit@proton.me).

Besides programming, I spend my free time playing video games, hanging out with friends, volunteering, reading, and competitive swimming with [Scarlet Aquatics](https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/SCAR-NJ1/page/home).
